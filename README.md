## Homemade Neural Network

This project aims to provide a foundational understanding of neural networks by implementing them from scratch. It serves as an educational tool for those interested in the inner workings of neural networks without relying on high-level libraries.

## Features

- **Customizable Layers**: Build neural networks with varying numbers of layers and units per layer.
- **Activation Functions**: Implement and experiment with different activation functions.
- **Loss Functions**: Utilize various loss functions to evaluate model performance.
- **Training Algorithms**: Train networks using backpropagation and gradient descent.

## Installation

To set up the project locally:

1. **Clone the repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/martonbakk/Homemade-NN.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the project directory**:

   ```bash
   cd Homemade-NN
   ```

3. **Install dependencies**:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

After installation, you can start building and training your neural networks. Refer to the provided example scripts for guidance:

- **XOR Problem**: Demonstrates training a network to solve the XOR logic gate problem.

  ```bash
  python testnn_xor.py
  ```

- **Image Classification**: Shows how to train a network for basic image classification tasks.

  ```bash
  python testnn_pic.py
  ```

These scripts illustrate how to define network architectures, specify activation and loss functions, and train the models.
